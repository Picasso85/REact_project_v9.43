How to Work with React and JSON Server

Download React Library: Firstly, download the React library.

Run JSON Server: Start the JSON Server using PowerShell by following these steps:

Enter the command in the console: npx json-server events.json.
If you see the following in the console:
vbnet
Copy code
JSON Server started on PORT :3000
Press CTRL-C to stop
Watching events.json...

Index:
http://localhost:3000/

Static files:
Serving ./public directory if it exists

Endpoints:
http://localhost:3000/users
http://localhost:3000/events
http://localhost:3000/categories
it means that the JSON Server has been successfully started.
Run React Project: Next, run the React project using another PowerShell by following these steps:

Enter the command: npm run dev.
If you see:
css
Copy code
> exercise-proptypes@0.0.0 dev

VITE v4.5.2  ready in 387 ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
➜  press h to show help
it means that the React project has been successfully started.
